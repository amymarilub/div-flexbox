                I have lived in San Antonio, Texas for the last 14 years. I was actually born in Tucson, Arizona. My dad was in the US Air Force
                until my sophomore year of high school.
                I have enjoyed setting up roots in Texas because I grew up moving a lot.

                My passion is helping people. I love using my ability to pay close attention to details to help find solutions for people. Currently, I do this
                by helping pet parents find all of their pet needs. But would love to use this passion to create beautiful websites that could help people run their businesses.

                Fun Fact: I have grown up thinking that I could never keep plants alive. Only to find out during quarantine that I love taking care of house plants! Still new
                to plants but it has become an obsession!
